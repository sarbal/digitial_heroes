# Digital Heroes: Using Computer Science to Battle Diseases
Your mission: 
Understand the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic (and the disease), and suggest a way to cure it. 
Throughout the workshop, we will be asking you to go to a few websites. They are listed below with the instructions too.  

## Your turn: Sequence alignment 
1. Go to [https://teacheng.illinois.edu/SequenceAlignment/](https://teacheng.illinois.edu/SequenceAlignment/) 
2. Try to reach the maximum score by adding gaps or allowing for mismatches

## Your turn: sequence search
1. Go to [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
2. Type in “SARS-COV-2” and spike
3. Note the amount of information available!!!
4. Click on “Nucleotide” and first entry

## Your turn: Structure search
1. Go to [https://www.rcsb.org/](https://www.rcsb.org/)
2. Type “sars-cov-2 spike” – a drop down menu should pop up
3. Select “SARS-CoV-2 Spike, VIRAL PROTEIN”

## Your turn: which cells can get infected?!
1. Go to: [https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/gene-expression](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/gene-expression)
2. In the filters sidebar, under Disease, select COVID-19
3. Under Tissue select lung
4. In the “Add genes” box, type in these genes: ACE2  TMPRSS2   ADAM17

## Your turn: where should we target?
1. Go to [https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global/6m](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global/6m)
2. Look at the regions that are “conserved” (do not change, not many "bars") 
3. Look at the regions that are “variable” (change the most, lots of high bars)

Probably didn't have time to reach this part: 

## Your turn: what else can we learn about COVID?
1. Go to [https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/edc8d3fe-153c-4e3d-8be0-2108d30f8d70.cxg/](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/edc8d3fe-153c-4e3d-8be0-2108d30f8d70.cxg/)
2. Select the cells with COVID19
3. Select the cells without 
4. Perform differential expression
